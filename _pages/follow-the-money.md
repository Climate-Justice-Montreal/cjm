Climate Justice Montreal is calling for a boycott of the Metro grocery stores, particularly the one on Avenue du Parc and Prince-Arthur, due to Metro board member Maryse Bertrand [encouraging McGill University to continue its objectionable investments](https://www.mcgill.ca/boardofgovernors/files/boardofgovernors/06._gd19-50_camsr_report.pdf){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in the fossil fuel industry.

This is unacceptable considering:
* According to [McGillInvests.in](https://mcgillinvests.in){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} McGill invests $50 million in fossil fuels such as coal, the tar sands, and pipeline companies, companies that invest billions per year in lobbying, unethical exporation, and campaign financing against needed climate policies
* Divestment at McGill is supported by [professors](http://www.mcgilltribune.com/news/mcgill-senate-votes-to-support-divestment-091818/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, employee unions, and all student unions
  * Since 2012, [Divest McGill](https://www.divestmcgill.com/our-work){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} has been calling on McGill University to respect indigenous land and the climate science by divesting from all fossil fuel companies
* Ms. Bertrand's behaviour is so objectionable that a tenured professor of environmental ethics [quit his job at McGill](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mcgill-university-professor-resigns-amid-refusal-to-divest-1.5426979){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in protest
* Le comportement de Mme. Bertrand est si atroce qu'[un professeur en éthique environnement a démissionné de son poste](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mcgill-university-professor-resigns-amid-refusal-to-divest-1.5426979){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}

This isn’t just about the dozens of millions of dollars that McGill invests in these companies, but also a matter of principle. These investments threaten everyone’s future, including that of McGill students and their families.

Because that metro grocery store is particularly McGill-dependent, we call upon locals and McGill students and staff to boycott Metro, and let store management know by calling (514) 843-3530.
