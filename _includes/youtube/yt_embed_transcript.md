I’m the world’s hip-hoppiest oil lobbyist
Dope at my job, I’m a pro, no hobbyist
And I feel the awfullest, man I can’t stand
the way people misunderstand Transcanada.

Damn it bro, I’m yellin’ like tarzan
when I hear a harsh animosity for our plans.
Yeah, we’re gonna scar up the land but 
We’re embarked on a grand project: 
we’re extracting oil from the tar sands!

So I had to write rhymes, 
cuz it’s the struggle of a lifetime!
For Energy East and Keystone XL
I had to pipe up for the pipelines.

Tree-huggers chill, please try to stress less.
If there’s a spill there’ll be a mess, yes.
But then there’s a clean-up and that means jobs.
Um, that’s the opposite of a problem.

Other people say building these pipes
is gonna infringe on indigenous rights.
Forcing the Dene, Métis, and the Cree 
off of their ancestral territory.

They say we destroy culture and tradition,
Poisoning the land they live, hunt, and fish in.
Making them sick, and depressed and to boot,
They’re left economically destitute.

Well, shoot, our oil is so above board
that we bought the URL ethicaloil.org
This crew’s harmless, kindly, and sweet.
It even helps little old ladies cross streets.

And if some native community gets in our way, 
we’ll buy ‘em off cheap with impunity!
Oops, ha, foolish me, I mean 
we provide short-term development opportunities.

Now, still others believe that these projects
are only going to deepen wealthy peeps’ pockets.
Leaving folks hurtin’ from the burden 
while the oil’s only squirtin’ pay-dirt out for certain Albertans.

Look, I gotta put an end to it.
There will be a nation-wide economic benefit.
Sure, most people won’t have it. 
But we’ll be living so dang lavish 
that we’ll jack up the national average.

And there’s just one final thang: 
let me talk to these fools with their minds deranged,
and chocked full of these half-cocked kinds of claims 
about the insane dangers of climate change.

Nature-lovers say we’ll produce as much carbon
as putting, like, seven million new cars on the roads each year.
Well, haters be damned.
We plan to meet Canada’s energy demand.

And if you hate the pipes and you’re not a supporter,
We’ve got some good news for ya:
You won’t even have to think about the barrels we extract,
Cuz almost every one, we’re gonna export on.

And even if you’re proven right one day
and the temperature climbs too high then hey,
We can hop in our tar-sands powered cars
flip on the AC, and drive away.

I’ve got protesters in my sight lines,
Demonstratin’ ‘bout the pipelines
They put the “mental” in environmental.
Man, they are not in their right minds.

Well, they can go ahead and bite mine
Cuz we got ‘em in a tight bind.

Keep complainin’, you’re never gonna win,
so you can just pipe down about the pipelines.

I’m out!
