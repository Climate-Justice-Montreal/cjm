There are many ways to support the Metro boycott.

## As a group

* Endorse the Metro Boycott by [emailing Divest McGill](divestmcgill@gmail.com). The name of your organisation will then be added to the list of signatories once this petition is released publicly and sent to media.
* Invite your members to stop buying at Metro grocery stores
* Invite your members to take part in the biweekly pickets organized by Divest McGill in Tiohtià:ke/Mooniyang (Montreal)
* Organize a postering activity with your members (We can mail you the materials or you can create your own posters)
* Organize your own pickets in front of Metro grocery stores in your area 
  * Reach out to [Divest McGill](divestmcgill@gmail.com) to know more about how to organize them and what messaging to use with the public
* Share the social media content created by @divestmcgill to advertise the boycott campaign
* Adopt a policy forbidding members of your group to make expenses for the group at Metro
* [Contact Metro Inc.](https://corpo.metro.ca/en/quebec-contact.html){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} or [McGill's Board of Governors](mailto:bog.mcgill@mcgill.ca) to inform them of your support of the Metro Boycott campaign and call on McGill to divest from the fossil fuel industry

## As an individual

* Stop buying at Metro

* [Contact Metro Inc.](https://corpo.metro.ca/en/quebec-contact.html){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to let them know you will no longer be buying at Metro grocery stores as long as they haven't met the demands put forward by Divest McGill
