You may already know that we're targeting Metro in an effort to push McGill to divest from fossil fuels. [Long story short](https://www.instagram.com/p/CESJ0AXgqYj/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, Maryse Bertrand is on the board at Metro grocery stores and also at McGill University. She's also one of the key people blocking McGill's endowment funds from divesting.

As we've been protesting outside of Metro Parc, we've also been sharing photos via Instagram and, guess what? Looks like @metromonepicier has been seeing our posts and stories.

**Now, we're asking for your help.**

**Would you be able to [download these Instagram stories templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-kfyxJZWi9jujWScf3rO3h0awC4JMeNL?usp=sharing){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to share why you don't shop at Metro Parc?**

Tag @justiceclimatiquemtl and @metromonepicier and help us ramp up the pressure!

### Stuck on what to say? 
Below are some points we've brainstormed together (feel free to make them your own!).
* Board member Maryse Bertrand also sits on the board of McGill and is blocking divestment from fossil fuels
* They are complicit in board member Maryse Bertrand enabling McGill's $50M investment in fossil fuels
* I'm pressuring board member Maryse Bertrand to change her mind about McGill's divestment from fossil fuels
Tag us in your IG stories and we'll re-share! Thank you so much for your support.
